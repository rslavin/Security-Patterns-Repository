    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Design</a></h2>
    	<strong>Description</strong>
		<p>The design pattern is the most abundant type of pattern. Such patterns 
			Describe a solution to a recurring problem for software design.
			Most other pattern types are based on the idea of a design pattern.</p>
		
		<strong>Criteria</strong>
		<p>Patterns were categorized as <i>design</i> patterns if their respective
			authors described them as such.</p>
	
	<br />
	

    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Requirement</a></h2>
		<p>Requirements patterns provide a solution to recurring requirements problems
			or situations. These types of patterns do not deal with the design or 
			implementation of a system. Instead, they provide clear organization
			for eliciting and creating requirements for the system.</p>
			
			<strong>Criteria</strong>
		<p>Patterns were categorized as <i>requirements</i> patterns if their respective
			authors described them as such.</p>
	
	<br />
	
	
    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Architectural</a></h2>
		<p>Architectural patterns describe a recurring solution to an architectural
			design problem. Such patterns generally include design, requirements, security, 
			and even hardware information.</p>
			
			<strong>Criteria</strong>
		<p>Patterns were categorized as <i>architectural</i> patterns if their respective
			authors described them as such.</p>
	
	<br />
	
	
    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Implementation</a></h2>
		<p>Implementation patterns focus on helping software developers write effective 
			and flexible code. </p>
			
			<strong>Criteria</strong>
		<p>Patterns were categorized as <i>implementation</i> patterns if their respective
			authors described them as such.</p>
	
	<br />
	
	
    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Procedural</a></h2>
		<p>Procedural patterns are similar to design patterns in that they describe a way 
			to design a solution to a recurring problem. The difference is that procedural
			patterns generally provide a method or set of steps to accomplish something. Such
			patterns will describe the actions that need to be taken by the system and the
			users of the system in order to accomplish the procedural task.</p>
			
			<strong>Criteria</strong>
		<p>Patterns were categorized as <i>procedural</i> patterns if their respective
			authors described them as such.</p>
	
	<br />
	
	
    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Mini</a></h2>
		<p>We classify solutions for recurring problems which are not specified in 
			large amounts of text as mini patterns. Generally, such patterns address
			a simple problem with a solution that can be fully described on a single 
			note card. In some cases, these patterns are explicitely described as mini
			patterns by their respective authors and may have larger representations.</p>
