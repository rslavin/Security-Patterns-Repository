    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Design</a></h2>
		<p>The design pattern is the most abundant type of pattern. Such patterns 
			Describe a solution to a recurring problem for software design.
			Most other pattern types are based on the idea of a design pattern.</p>

    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Requirement</a></h2>
		<p>Requirements patterns provide a solution to recurring requirements problems
			or situations. These types of patterns do not deal with the design or 
			implementation of a system. Instead, they provide clear orgnaization
			for eliciting and creating requirements for the system.</p>

    	<h2><a href="/patterns/design">Mini</a></h2>
		<p>We classify solutions for recurring problems which are not specified in 
			large amounts of text as mini patterns. Generally, such patterns address
			a simple problem with a solution that can be fully described on a single 
			note card. In some cases, these patterns are explicitely described as mini
			patterns by their respective authors and may have larger representations.</p>
